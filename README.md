👋 Hi, we are @codeforgoodberkeley, the official GitHub for the Code For Good coding club at UC Berkeley. We work to support non-profit organizations with technology solutions to help bring positive change in our communities. We design, plan, and build ambitious new coding projects every semester. Check us out at https://codeforgoodberkeley.github.io/!
